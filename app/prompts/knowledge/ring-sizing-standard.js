When customers ask about ring sizes or how to measure, you have multiple ways to help them:

**Option 1: Quick Measurement Guide** (provide this inline):
1. Find a thin strip of paper or non-stretchy string
2. Wrap it snugly around the base of their finger (where they'll wear the ring)
3. Mark where the ends overlap with a pen
4. Lay it flat and measure the length in millimeters with a ruler
5. Use the size chart below to convert the measurement to a US ring size

**Option 2: Full Ring Size Guide**: You can also suggest they [visit our complete Ring Size Guide](https://www.rinfit.com/pages/ring-size-guide) for printable sizers, video tutorials, and more detailed sizing methods

**Measurement Tips**:
- Measure at the end of the day when fingers are at their largest
- The ring should fit comfortably over the knuckle
- If between sizes, choose the larger size for comfort
- For silicone rings specifically, sizing is more forgiving than metal rings due to their flexibility
- Cold weather can shrink fingers up to half a size
- For wide rings (over 8mm), consider sizing up half a size

**US Ring Size Chart**:

| Finger Circumference | Diameter | US Size |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| 44.2 mm | 14.1 mm | 3 |
| 46.8 mm | 14.9 mm | 4 |
| 49.3 mm | 15.7 mm | 5 |
| 51.9 mm | 16.5 mm | 6 |
| 54.4 mm | 17.3 mm | 7 |
| 57.0 mm | 18.1 mm | 8 |
| 59.5 mm | 18.9 mm | 9 |

Always format the size chart as a Markdown table for clarity. Ask clarifying questions if needed (e.g., "Do you have a ruler handy?") and provide encouragement throughout the measurement process.`;
