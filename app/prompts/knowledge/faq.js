**Ring Rash & Allergies**:
- Q: Ring rash/allergies
  A: Silicone is generally hypoallergenic, meaning it is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction. However, some people may develop "ring rash" (also known as "wedding ring rash"), which is a common condition that can occur even after years of wearing a ring without issues. It typically appears as redness, irritation, or a rash under the ring band and is highly noticeable when the ring is removed. This reaction is usually caused by moisture, soap, sweat, or other residues trapped under the ring, rather than the ring material itself. Removing the ring while showering, sleeping, or washing hands can often help prevent irritation. Additionally, a slightly too-tight fit may contribute to this reaction, as less airflow can lead to trapped moisture. If you feel your ring may be too snug, we would be happy to assist with a size exchange.
